            <h2>About Team</h2>
            <p>Team Trojan FC was formed in 2023 January. Due to some reasons, we will start operating the Facebook page from now on. Our team consists of {{ team_members }} members who are students and some are companies' professional personnel. The aims of this team
                are to relax all the tiredness of the team members of the whole week in the weekends or free times by doing sports what they love, to support physical health and to raise good friendship between teammates and other teams' members. We will
                upload our team's activities from now on, so please support us.</p>
